## Objectives
In this stage, create a database named card.s3db with a table titled card. It should have the following columns:

- id INTEGER
- number TEXT
- pin TEXT
- balance INTEGER DEFAULT 0

Pay attention: your database file should be created when the program starts if it hasnâ€™t yet been created. And all created cards should be stored in the database from now.

Do not forget to commit your DB changes right after executing a query!
