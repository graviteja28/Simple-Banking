## Objectives
You should allow customers to create a new account in our banking system.

Once the program starts you should print the menu:

1. Create an account
2. Log into the account
0. Exit

If the customer chooses ‘Create an account’, you should generate a new card number that satisfies all the conditions described above. Then you should generate a PIN code that belongs to the generated card number. PIN is a sequence of 4 digits; it should be generated in the range from 0000 to 9999.

If the customer chooses ‘Log into account’, you should ask to enter card information.

After the information has been entered correctly, you should allow the user to check the account balance; after creating the account, the balance should be 0. It should also be possible to log out of the account and exit the program.
